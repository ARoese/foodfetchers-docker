Docker compose of my [BS CompSci capstone project](https://github.com/foodfetcher/foodfetchers). This has some code changes to allow such a deployment, and will receive updates as I need them.

This compose consists of two containers:
    - A postgresql server
    - An apache http server serving PHP pages

The postgresql server *could* run in the same container as the apache server, but it's easier to set up and keep consistent like this. The postgresql container can just be dropped, reset, or backed up separately from the apache server without affecting it.

Dirs:
- **database**: database server-related files
  - **resetTables.sh**: initialization script which should be referenced for the database schema. 
  - **restore_dump.sh**: unused. This only remains for reference
- **scripts**: all assume defult database name and username
  - **db_console.ps1**: get an sql console to the postgresql database. Just simplifies the docker exec. Assumes default db name and user.
  - **dump_database.ps1**: dump the database to a given file
  - **restore_from_dump.ps1**: restore a dump generated by dump_database.ps1
- **site**: files related to the site hosting
  - **config**: apache server and php configuration
  - **html**: web root of the apache server. Has all the relevant php files.
